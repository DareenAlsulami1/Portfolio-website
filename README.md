Hello and welcome!

This is Dareen. I have made several changes to the template:

1. Home page: I replaced the picture with a cute animated girl that represents me. I also added my name and major. I removed the unnecessary buttons.

2. About page: I added another picture of the same animation girl along with a summary about myself.

3. Skills page: I listed my skills with their corresponding levels of proficiency.

4. Portfolio: I added pictures of my projects along with their names.

5. Contact information: I added my contact details and included a Google Maps section.

6. Footer: I made the footer sticky so that it remains fixed at the bottom of the page.

Additionally, I made some changes to fix validation errors. I resolved issues such as duplicated IDs, tags referencing external elements, and CSS properties without color names. You can check the Validation folder to see the updated version. I also uploaded a demo to showcase the responsiveness of the portfolio.

As an extra addition, I included Google Maps, a JavaScript file, and added a third viewport layout.

Feel free to explore the changes and let me know if you have any further questions. Thank you!
